// in cpp, treat the memory of a computer like a succession of memory cells, each with unique addresses
// ex the memory cell wtih address 1776 always follows immediately after the cell with 1775, and precedes the one with 1777


// addres-of operator: &
// foo = &myvar; // assigns the address of myvar to foo
// foo is now a pointer

// dereference operator: *
// get the value pointed to by the pointer
// baz = *foo; // get the value that foo points to, store it in baz

 // example with declaring pointers
#include<iostream>

int main(){
    {
